# GYMDOLPHIN


GYMDOLPHIN is an E-commerce gym gear store simulation that offers users the flexibility to log in, register, or proceed as a guest. Password recovery via email is integrated into the app. All item listings are dynamically fetched from a Firebase database, ensuring real-time updates on stock counts. The payment activity is implemented using fragments, providing a seamless user experience.

One notable feature is the ability to save the shopping cart into the database, allowing users to retrieve their cart dynamically upon logging back into the app. Each user has their own corresponding cart, providing a tailored and convenient shopping experience. Additionally, users can easily update and modify their profile information directly within the app.

The development process involved the use of various tools, including Figma for wireframing, Photoshop for creating the logo, Firebase for database management, and Android Studio for development environment. I selected these tools based on my familiarity with their functionalities. In Android Studio, I used Java for both backend and frontend development, while XML was applied for app layout, and frontend design.
